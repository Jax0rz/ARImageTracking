# ARImageTracking
 
This is an Augmented Reality Xcode project that uses Apple's newest RealityKit framework and ARKit 4 features, to dynamically track a moving image in the real world. It is written as a SwiftUI project.

The exmaple video and image used in my project is of an iPhone Xs screen recording and iPhone Xs box.Do swap the video and image out to whatever you want to track and overlay.

Contributions are welcome!
Tested on iOS 14.3 and requires an iDevice with an A12 chip or higher to run.
